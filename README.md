## 🧠 Architecture

> *“If Zillow and GPT had a genius child raised by NASA and Reddit, it would be REIC.”*

REIC uses a **layered temporal inference architecture**, which allows it to process:
- **Historical trends** (property, sentiment, economics)
- **Live overlays** (social buzz, local discussions, safety)
- **Predictive modeling** (market moves, neighborhood shifts, culture changes)

All while remaining modular, API-first, and private by default.

## 🌌 The Vision

REIC is a new kind of infrastructure —  
A **truth-seeking AI engine** built to restore trust, autonomy, and intelligence to the real estate experience.

We believe:
- You deserve to *feel* a place before you *buy* it.
- Data should serve people, not confuse them.
- AI should be a **butler, not a broker**.

REIC is built for the future we *want* to live in.
