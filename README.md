## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- API keys for external services (instructions below)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lmcdonald6/ATT-FIN-Real-Estate-AI-BOT.git
cd ATT-FIN-Real-Estate-AI-BOT
```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# Airtable Configuration
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_airtable_base_id
AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID=your_airtable_table_id

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4
MAX_TOKENS=4096
TEMPERATURE=0.7
```

5. **Initialize the database:**
```bash
python setup_airtable.py
```

6. **Run the development server:**
```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Running Microservices

For detailed instructions on setting up and running each microservice individually, see [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

### Docker Containerization

The entire application can be run using Docker and Docker Compose for simplified deployment and management:

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs from all services
docker-compose logs -f

# View logs from a specific service
docker-compose logs -f financial_analysis

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

Each microservice has its own Dockerfile and can be built and run independently:

```bash
# Build a specific service
docker-compose build dashboard

# Start only specific services
docker-compose up -d api_gateway financial_analysis dashboard
```

The API Gateway provides a unified entry point for all services at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Service Architecture

Our microservice architecture follows these key principles:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service has a specific, well-defined function
2. **Independent Deployability**: Services can be deployed independently
3. **Domain-Driven Design**: Services are organized around business capabilities
4. **Containerization**: Docker-based deployment for consistency and isolation
5. **API Gateway Pattern**: Unified entry point for all services
6. **Structured Logging**: Consistent logging format across all services

## Usage Examples

### API Endpoints

```python
import requests

# Get market analysis for a location
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/market-analysis", params={"location": "Austin, TX"})
market_data = response.json()
print(market_data)

# Get property recommendations
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/property-recommendations", 
                      params={"location": "Austin, TX", "budget": 500000})
recommendations = response.json()
print(recommendations)
```

### Dashboard

Access the interactive dashboard at http://localhost:8501 after starting the dashboard service:

```bash
cd dashboard_service
streamlit run app.py
```

```bash
cd data_scraping_service
python main.py --location "New York, NY" --max-results 20 --sync
```

# Analyze investment potential
property_data = {
    "address": "123 Main St, Austin, TX",
    "price": 450000,
    "bedrooms": 3,
    "bathrooms": 2,
    "sqft": 1800
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8001/analyze-investment", json=property_data)
analysis = response.json()
print(analysis)
```

### Model Auditing

```bash
cd model_audit_service
python main.py audit-price --model models/price_prediction.pkl --test-data data/test_data.csv --target price
```

### AI Tools Integration

```bash
cd ai_tools_directory
python main.py integrate zillow_api_integration
python main.py call zillow_api_integration get_property_details --args '["48749425"]'
```

## Logging

The system implements a comprehensive structured logging system with JSON formatting for better integration with log aggregation tools. Our enhanced logging configuration provides:

1. **Centralized Logging**: All logs are stored in the `logs` directory by default
2. **Service-Specific Logging**: Each microservice has its own log directory
3. **JSON Formatting**: Logs are formatted as JSON for better parsing and analysis
4. **Contextual Information**: Each log entry includes service name, module, function, and line number
5. **Exception Tracking**: Detailed exception information with stack traces
6. **Log Levels**: Different log files for different severity levels (INFO, ERROR, etc.)

### Log File Locations

- Core API: `logs/api/api.log`
- Dashboard Service: `logs/dashboard_service/dashboard.log`
- Data Scraping Service: `logs/data_scraping_service/scraper.log`
- Financial Analysis Service: `logs/financial_analysis_service/analysis.log`
- Model Audit Service: `logs/model_audit_service/audit.log`
- AI Tools Directory: `logs/ai_tools_directory/ai_tools.log`
- API Gateway: `logs/api_gateway/gateway.log`

### Using the Logger

```python
# Import the service logger setup function
from src.utils.logging_config import setup_service_logging

# Setup service-specific logging
get_logger = setup_service_logging("service_name", "INFO")

# Get a logger for a specific module with optional context
logger = get_logger("module_name", {"context_key": "context_value"})

# Log messages
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.error("An error occurred", exc_info=True)  # Includes exception info if available
```

Log levels can be configured in each service's configuration file or when setting up the logger.

## Testing

We use pytest for comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing across all microservices. Our testing strategy follows these principles:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage across all services
2. **Isolated Testing**: Each service has its own test suite that can run independently
3. **Mock External Dependencies**: All external services and APIs are properly mocked
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Tests run automatically on each commit
5. **Performance Testing**: Critical paths are tested for performance regressions

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install testing dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-mock pytest-asyncio

# Run all tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing tests/

# Run tests for a specific module
pytest tests/unit/test_logging_config.py -v

# Run tests with specific markers
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Service-Specific Tests

Each microservice has its own test suite that can be run independently:

```bash
# Run tests for a specific service
cd financial_analysis_service
pytest --cov=. tests/

# Run tests in Docker containers
docker-compose run financial_analysis pytest
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **API Tests**: Test API endpoints using FastAPI TestClient
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows across services
