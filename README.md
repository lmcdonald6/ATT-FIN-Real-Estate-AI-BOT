# Natural language query through the conversation endpoint
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/conversation/query",
    json={
        "prompt": "What's the investment potential for ZIP code 90210 over the next 5 years?",
        "zip_code": "90210"
    }
)
result = response.json()

# Get street-level sentiment analysis
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/sentiment",
    json={"zip": "90210"}
)
sentiment = response.json()

## 🌌 The Vision

REIC represents a fundamental reimagining of real estate intelligence — 
A **truth-seeking cognitive engine** designed to restore transparency, insight, and human-centered understanding to property markets.

We believe:
- Property decisions should incorporate both **emotional intelligence** and **quantitative analysis**
- Neighborhoods are living organisms with **unique personalities** that evolve over time
- Data should illuminate possibilities, not obscure them behind complexity
- AI should augment human decision-making, not replace it

REIC is engineered for the future of real estate — where decisions are informed by a complete understanding of both the tangible and intangible factors that create long-term value.
