## 🧠 Architecture

> *“If Zillow and GPT had a genius child raised by NASA and Reddit, it would be REIC.”*

REIC uses a **layered temporal inference architecture**, which allows it to process:
- **Historical trends** (property, sentiment, economics)
- **Live overlays** (social buzz, local discussions, safety)
- **Predictive modeling** (market moves, neighborhood shifts, culture changes)

All while remaining modular, API-first, and private by default.
