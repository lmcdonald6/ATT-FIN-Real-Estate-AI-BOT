## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- ATTOM API key (for production)
- Git

### Installation

#### Windows
1. Clone the repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real_estate_bot.git
   cd real_estate_bot
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```powershell
   # Using PowerShell
   $env:ATTOM_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   
   # Or create a .env file
   echo "ATTOM_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
   ```

#### macOS/Linux
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real_estate_bot.git
   cd real_estate_bot
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   # Using terminal
   export ATTOM_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   
   # Or create a .env file
   echo "ATTOM_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
   ```

### Configuration
The system uses environment variables for configuration. You can either:
1. Set them in your shell session as shown above
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root
3. Use your IDE's environment variable configuration

Required variables:
```
ATTOM_API_KEY=your_key_here          # Required for production
MOCK_DATA_ENABLED=true               # Optional, default: true
CACHE_TTL=86400                      # Optional, default: 24 hours
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                       # Optional, default: INFO
```

### Development Setup

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_gateway_new.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src tests/
```

#### Code Style
We use black for code formatting and flake8 for linting:
```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Run linter
flake8 src/ tests/
```

### Usage
1. Initialize the market toolkit:
   ```python
   from src.analysis.market_toolkit import MarketToolkit
   toolkit = MarketToolkit()
   ```

2. Analyze a market:
   ```python
   results = toolkit.analyze_market("37215", properties)
   ```

3. Get property predictions:
   ```python
   predictions = toolkit.predict_property_values(properties, market_data)
   ```
